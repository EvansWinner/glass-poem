This very short Emacs Lisp program is a kind of a conceptual joke. The
program takes a line of text as input and produces a “poem” as output
which is based on what I took as the developmental technique of
*Strung Out* for amplified violin, by Philip Glass (whose music I
cannot abide, by the way). I wrote a poem for a friend by hand myself
first, called ‘ONLY WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP DO THE MONSTERS COME OUT,’
and then, realizing how easily the basic technique could be automated,
wrote this short program.
